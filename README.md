# BoxRoam
(Fadel Akbar Putra, Rizal Abdaan,Emir Muhamad Zaid)

Need a ride? we provide seats inside a metal box that roams around the fantasy land of Kalipo! Cheap Seats, and Cheap Souls!

Here is the project for the Sistem Basis Data (Database) University of Indonesia Course. we should clarify that the metal box is essentially what a bus is, and most buses usually roam around the country, hence the name BoxRoam.

This is the Frontend and Backend stack, developed using NodeJS, ExpressJS, PasportJS, Postgre, Github Action, and Azure Apps. in the website you can register, login, check for available seats, order seats. you can also register as a staff, which provides the bus details, manifest, commission and decommision buses, add and remove routes, and passenger details.
